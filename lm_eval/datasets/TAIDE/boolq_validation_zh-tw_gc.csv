does ethanol take more energy make that produces,生產乙醇需要更多的能量嗎,False,"All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.",所有生物質至少都會經歷以下一些步驟：需要生長、收集、乾燥、發酵、蒸餾和燃燒。所有這些步驟都需要資源和基礎設施。輸入到該過程中的能量總量與燃燒所得乙醇燃料所釋放的能量相比，被稱為能量平衡（或“能量投資回報的能量”）。國家地理雜誌 2007 年的一份報告中彙編的數據表明，美國生產的玉米乙醇的效果並不理想：需要 1 個單位的化石燃料能源才能從所得乙醇中生產 1.3 個能源單位。巴西生產的甘蔗乙醇的能源平衡更為有利，需要 1 單位的化石燃料能源才能生產 8 單位的乙醇。能量平衡估計不容易產生，因此已經生成了大量相互矛盾的此類報告。例如，一項單獨的調查報告稱，用甘蔗生產乙醇需要熱帶氣候才能高效生長，每消耗一單位可回收 8 至 9 個單位的能源，而玉米僅回收約 1.34 個單位的燃料能源每消耗一個單位的能量。加州大學伯克利分校 2006 年的一項研究在分析了六項獨立研究後得出結論，用玉米生產乙醇比生產汽油消耗的石油少得多。
is house tax and property tax are same,房屋稅和房產稅是一樣的嗎,True,"Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.",財產稅或“房屋稅”是對建築物及其附屬土地徵收的地方稅。它是強加給所有者的（不是 1978 年憲法第 44 修正案規定的財產保管人）。它類似於美國型財富稅，但不同於英國消費稅型稅率。稅收權力屬於各州，並委託給地方機構，規定估價方法、稅率範圍和徵收程序。稅基是年租金值 (ARV) 或基於區域的評級。自住房產和其他不產生租金的房產根據成本進行評估，然後通過應用一定比例的成本（通常為 4%）將其轉換為 ARV。空置土地一般是免稅的。中央政府財產除外。相反，行政命令允許收取“服務費”。外國使團的財產也享受免稅，無需互惠。該稅通常伴隨著服務稅，例如水稅、排水稅、保護（衛生）稅、照明稅，均使用相同的稅基。農村 (panchayat) 房產的稅率結構持平，但在城市 (市政) 地區，稅率結構略有進步，約 80% 的評估屬於前兩個等級。
is pain experienced in a missing body part or paralyzed area,身體缺失部位或癱瘓部位是否感到疼痛,True,"Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body.

can an odd number be divided by an even number,奇數可以除以偶數嗎,True,"In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: even or odd. An integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include −4, 0, 82 and 178. In particular, zero is an even number. Some examples of odd numbers are −5, 3, 29, and 73.",在數學中，奇偶性是整數包含在兩個類別之一的屬性：偶數或奇數。如果一個整數能被二整除，則該整數為偶數；如果該整數不是偶數，則該整數為奇數。例如，6 是偶數，因為除以 2 時沒有餘數。相比之下，3、5、7、21 除以 2 時餘數為 1。偶數的示例包括 -4、0、82 和 178 . 特別地，零是偶數。奇數的一些例子有 -5、3、29 和 73。

do you need to break in a car,你需要開車嗎,False,"A new engine is broken in by following specific driving guidelines during the first few hours of its use. The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the piston rings of the engine and the cylinder wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use. For example, the manual will specify that the car be driven normally, but not in excess of the highway speed limit.",新發動機在使用的最初幾個小時內需要遵循特定的駕駛指南來進行磨合。發動機磨合的重點是發動機活塞環與氣缸壁之間的接觸。對於磨合發動機，沒有通用的準備或一套說明。最重要的是，對於以高功率啟動發動機還是以低功率啟動發動機來磨合發動機更好，專家們意見不一。雖然磨合不成功仍然會產生後果，但現代發動機比舊型號發動機更難量化。一般來說，人們在購買汽車或摩托車後不再對自己車輛的發動機進行磨合，因為這個過程是在生產過程中完成的。即使在今天，用戶手冊建議首先溫和使用（通常指定為前 500 或 1000 公里或英里）的情況仍然很常見。但通常只是正常使用，沒有指定過多的要求，而不是輕度/有限使用。例如，手冊會規定汽車可以正常行駛，但不能超過高速公路的限速。

can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen,碳可以與氫形成極性共價鍵嗎,False,"The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 Å (1.09 × 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C−H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.",碳氫鍵（C--H鍵）是碳原子和氫原子之間的鍵，存在於許多有機化合物中。該鍵是共價鍵，這意味著碳與最多四個氫共享其外層價電子。這樣就完成了它們的兩個外殼，使它們變得穩定。碳-氫鍵的鍵長約為 1.09 Å (1.09 × 10 m)，鍵能約為 413 kJ/mol（見下表）。使用鮑林尺度——C (2.55) 和 H (2.2)——這兩個原子之間的電負性差為 0.35。由於電負性差異很小，C−H 鍵通常被認為是非極性的。在分子結構式中，氫原子常常被省略。僅由 C--H 鍵和 C--C 鍵組成的化合物類別為烷烴、烯烴、炔烴和芳香烴。它們統稱為碳氫化合物。

He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that ``when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.'' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: ``Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.'' In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, ``No! You are not dead!'' A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor, Meredith Fell, tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood. The last shot of the season finale episode shows Elena in transition.",在第三季中，在斯特凡成為克勞斯的追隨者後，達蒙幫助艾琳娜將他的兄弟斯特凡帶回神秘瀑布。這一安排是在達蒙與泰勒討價還價後達成的，達蒙的血可以治愈他被狼人咬傷的傷口。起初，他不願意讓艾琳娜參與營救，而是僱用了艾琳娜的監護人阿拉里克·薩爾茲曼，因為克勞斯在犧牲後不知道艾琳娜還活著，而這犧牲了克勞斯的混血兒一面。然而，埃琳娜卻捲入其中，迫切地想要找到斯特凡。達蒙雖然一開始有些猶豫，但由於對她的愛而無法拒絕她。他還向她指出，她曾經因為知道達蒙會有危險而放棄尋找斯特凡，這清楚地表明她對他也有感情。他告訴她，“當（他）將（他的）兄弟從邊緣拖回（她）身邊時，（他）希望她記住他離開時的感受。”當斯特凡最終回到神秘瀑佈時，他的態度與第一季和第二季有所不同。這導致埃琳娜和斯特凡之間產生裂痕，而達蒙和埃琳娜之間的關係卻變得更加親密。然而，仍然忠誠的埃琳娜拒絕承認她對達蒙的感情。在《危險關係》中，埃琳娜對達蒙的感情感到沮喪，她告訴達蒙，他對她的愛可能是個問題，這可能是他們所有麻煩的根源。這激怒了達蒙，導致他又回到了前幾季中那種漠不關心、魯莽的達蒙。兩人之間的不穩定關係一直持續到性緊張達到了極限，在激烈的激情時刻，埃琳娜——這三個季節中的第一次——主動親吻了達蒙。這個吻最終使埃琳娜承認她愛這兩個兄弟，並意識到她最終必須做出自己的選擇，就像她自己的祖先凱瑟琳·皮爾斯（凱瑟琳·皮爾斯，凱瑟琳·皮爾斯，凱瑟琳·皮爾斯，凱瑟琳·皮爾斯，凱瑟琳·皮爾斯）曾經做過的那樣。在評估她對達蒙的感情時，她這樣說道：“達蒙有點偷偷靠近我。他讓我很惱火，無論我做什麼，我都無法動搖他。”在季終集，一次旨在讓她安全的旅行迫使埃琳娜做出選擇：去找達蒙，並可能見他一面上次;或者去找斯特凡和她的朋友們最後一次見他們。當她打電話給達蒙告訴他她的決定時，她選擇了後者。試圖阻止阿拉里克的達蒙接受了她的說法，她告訴他，如果她在遇到斯特凡之前遇到達蒙，她的選擇可能會有所不同。這句話讓達蒙想起了他見到埃琳娜的第一個晚上，事實上，也就是她父母去世的那天晚上——在她遇到斯特凡之前。達蒙不想讓任何人知道他在城裡，在給了她一些關於生活和愛情的建議後，達蒙強迫她忘記了。當他與阿拉里克戰鬥時，他記得這一點，當阿拉里克的生命線與埃琳娜的生命線相連時，他突然倒在他的懷裡，他似乎接受了自己的死亡。達蒙悲痛萬分，知道這意味著埃琳娜也死了，大喊道：“不！你沒有死！”心碎的達蒙隨後前往醫院，要求見埃琳娜，醫生梅雷迪思·菲爾告訴他，她給了埃琳娜吸血鬼的血液。本季最後一集的最後一個鏡頭展示了埃琳娜的轉變。

The US Open holds ``Super Saturday'' where the two men's semi-finals are played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event; therefore a tie-break is more prudent where player rest and scheduling is more important.",比賽的最後一盤有時不採用搶七，而是採用優勢盤。因此，決勝盤必須進行到一名選手或球隊比對手多贏兩局為止。四大網球錦標賽中的三個都是如此，除了美國公開賽，美國公開賽甚至在決勝盤（男子第五盤，女子第三盤）中也以 6--6 的比分進行搶七。其他三項大滿貫賽事——澳大利亞網球公開賽、法國網球公開賽和溫布爾登網球公開賽的決勝盤中不進行搶七。 （1971 年溫布爾登首次引入搶七局時，比賽的比分是 8--8，而不是 6--6。）美國公開賽舉辦“超級星期六”，兩人的半決賽與女子決賽在賽事的第二個週六進行；因此，搶七局更為謹慎，因為球員的休息和日程安排更為重要。

does a frog jump out of boiling water,青蛙會從沸水中跳出來嗎,True,"While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.",雖然一些 19 世紀的實驗表明，如果加熱足夠緩慢，則基本前提是正確的，但根據當代生物學家的說法，這個前提是錯誤的：逐漸加熱的青蛙會跳出來。事實上，通過改變位置進行體溫調節是青蛙和其他變溫動物基本必要的生存策略。

can someone die from a bullet shot in the air,有人會因為空中的子彈而死亡嗎,True,"Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground.
